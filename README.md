# Welcome Players!

Greetings, Huffoor! This document will guide you through the steps to solve this challenge and register your solution.

## Overview

This is the demo challenge for the Huffathon workshop.

Goals:

- Understand how to use this template to solve the challenge
- Understand how to submit your solution

## Instructions

For this challenge, you need to update the [PLAYER_SOLUTION.huff](src/PLAYER_SOLUTION.huff) file adding logic which will return `0x69` whenever the contract is called.

You can see the actual verification logic as well as the way gas is measured in [src/utils/CREATOR.sol](src/utils/CREATOR.sol).


## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repo**: Start by cloning this repository to your local machine.

```bash
git clone <REPO_URL>
```

If you're considering sharing your solution later or want to track your progress with commits, consider forking this repository. However, remember to keep your fork private initially to prevent others from seeing your solution.

2. **Solve the Puzzle**: Dive into the [PLAYER_SOLUTION.huff](src/PLAYER_SOLUTION.huff) file and work your magic to solve the challenge.

3. **Testing**: While solving, you can utilize the test suite [Solution.t.sol](test/Solution.t.sol) to validate your solution. Feel free to make changes to this file; it won't affect the main challenge or your submission. It's just there to assist you.

## Registering Your Solution

Once you're confident in your solution, register it with the HuffCTFRegistry on Optimism mainnet:

1. **Set Up Your Discord Handle**: Before running the registration script, set up an environment variable with your Discord handle (without the '@' symbol):

```bash
export PLAYER_HANDLE=devtooligan
```

2. **Run the Registration Script**: Use the following command to run the registration script:

```bash
forge script script/Solution.s.sol:Register --rpc-url <OPTIMISM RPC URL> --broadcast -vvvv
```

Note:
- This command sends a live transaction on Optimism. Replace `<OPTIMISM RPC URL>` with a valid URL.
- You'll need to use an actual wallet for the transaction. You can specify your wallet using the `--wallet` flag. Alternatively, you can input your private key in other ways, such as by using the `--interactive` flag. See [Foundry documentation](https://book.getfoundry.sh/) for more information.


Also note:
- You can also interact directly with the Optimism [block explorer](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0xf6aE79c0674df852104D214E16AC9c065DAE5896#writeContract). This is not the recommended way due to the danger of human error. If you want to see the exact input parameters you can run the Register script above and DO NOT use a private key.  The arguments will be console.logged for you.
## Wrapping Up

That's all there is to it! Once the CTF concludes, feel free to make your repository public. If your solution ranks among the top contenders, it will undergo a human review. Stay updated by keeping an eye on our Discord channel and Twitter feed.

Best of luck, and may the best coder win!
